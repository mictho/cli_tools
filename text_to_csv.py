import csv

# Written by Michel Thomasius - Copyright (C) 2023.
# Parses a simple text file with a repeating pattern of lines, inserts the text lines into variables, strips any leading and trailing white spaces and then inserts the data into columns in a CSV file
# Example source txt file:
# 18/07/2023
#
#
# Company 1
#
#
#  16.32
#
#
#  1234.00
#
# 17/07/2023
#
#
# company 2
#
#
#  221.74
#
#
#  2345.00
#
# 17/07/2023
#
#
# company 3
#
#
#  14.04
